# Frontend Mentor Projects Organization

## What is Frontend Mentor

**[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)** is a platform that allows your to improve you web development coding skills by building realistic projects. they have a list of challenges that are well designed. that you can choose to implement and submit on the platform.

There are three kinds of challenges in Frontend Mentor:

- **FREE :** All assets and designs are in the JPG Format. this means you have to use estimations for things like spacing, sizes and so on.

- **FREE+ :** With these challenges you are able to download Figma/Sketch Design files. this allow you to mimic real world development workflows. this type of challenges are a trial to premium content available with the PRO subscription.

- **PRO :** these challenges require a PRO paid subscription. they are premium challenges. where you can find multi page projects, fully functional applications. you have the design file included with a professional design system e.g. a system that helps you plan making reusable components and styles since it details the colors, font sizes and so on used in the design.

Some challenges require only HTML and CSS while others requires Javascript and APIs. the difficulty of challenges spans 5 levels:

1- Newbie

2- Junior

3- Intermediate

4- Advanced

5- Guru

After starting learning web development, I'm using Frontend Mentor to practice the technologies that I learn. this Org is created to host all of the projects that I have completed and to showcase my skills in web development.

Frontend Mentor also provides you roadmaps to navigate the challenges as a beginner to web development. they offer:

1- Getting started on Frontend Mentor

2- Building responsive layouts

3- JavaScript fundamentals

4- Intro to JavaScript frameworks

5- Intro to accessibility

I've been using these roadmap to navigate the challenges but as I completed all challenges in these roadmaps (other than the accessibility one). I'll be choosing what to work on from now on. based on the technologies I'm learning.

My Own Roadmaps:

- Modern Styling: Targets the trending and most used CSS styling tools. that make the development experience easier and lead to faster times styling the web.
